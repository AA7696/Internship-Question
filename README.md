### Question
Can you pack 53 bricks of dimension 1x1x4 into a 6x6x6 box?

### Solution

To solve this, calculate the volume of the box and the total volume of the bricks: - The volume of the box: 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 cubic units. - The volume of one brick: 1 x 1 x 4 = 4 cubic units. - The total volume of 53 bricks: 53 x 4 = 212 cubic units. Since the total volume of the bricks (212) is less than the volume of the box (216), packing them is theoretically possible. However, the challenge lies in the arrangement. The dimensions of the bricks (1x1x4) mean that careful placement is required to avoid gaps. The box's dimensions (6x6x6) are not perfectly divisible by the brick dimensions, which might leave unusable space. Conclusion: Itâ€™s possible to pack the bricks volume-wise, but physical arrangement may make it impractical.
